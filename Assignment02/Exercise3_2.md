# Exercise 3.2

## Regex
Write a regular expression that recognizes all sequences consisting of a and b where two aâ€™s are always separated by at least one b. For instance, these four strings are legal: b, a, ba, ababbbaba; but these two strings are illegal: aa, babaa.  

Solution:
```regexp
^(a?(ba|b)*)$
```

## NFA
Construct the corresponding NFA.

## DFA
Try to find a DFA corresponding to the NFA.

Solution:  

| State |  a  |  b  |  ba |    NFA States    | Accepting |
|:-----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:----------------:|:---------:|
|   S0  |  S1 | Err | Err | {q0, q1, q2, q4} |    Yes    |
|   S1  | Err |  S2 |  S3 |   {q1, q2, q4}   |    Yes    |
|   S2  | Err |  S2 |  S3 |   {q2, q3, q4}   |    Yes    |
|   S3  | Err |  S2 |  S3 |   {q2, q3, q4}   |    Yes    |

Note: There is an error in the regex, making it accept on empty string. This is the reason why the DFA is also accepting on S0.
