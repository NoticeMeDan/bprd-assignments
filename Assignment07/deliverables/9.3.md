Analyzing the code in `QueueWithMistake.java` it becomes clear that the dummy `Node` class is used wrong to optimize garbage collection. There is an extra dummy node which is used as a reference for the next node, but this means that garbage collection is not possible because of the next reference. So we remove the dummy entirely, which allows garbage collection upon calling the `get` method.
